This directory contains the extension for the FFTW (Fastest Fourier 
Transform in the West) library which can be found at *fftw.org*.

The extension relies on header files and libraries that you can download from 
the *fftw.org* site or from your operating systems package manager in some 
cases. You can also download the source code to build the library.

If you have placed the headers and libraries in some place not directly 
accessible to your compiler then you will need to set the *NIAL_FFTW_INCLUDE* 
and *NIAL_FFTW_LIB* environment variables before running CMake.
