This directory contains an extension to use the Audio component of
SFML (the Simple Fast Multimedia Library).

To include this extension you will need to download the C headers and libraries
for CSFML, the C interface to SFML, for your particular machine.

Once you have done that set the environment variables *NIAL_SFML_INCLUDE* and 
*NIAL_SFML_LIB* to the appropriate directories before running CMake.
