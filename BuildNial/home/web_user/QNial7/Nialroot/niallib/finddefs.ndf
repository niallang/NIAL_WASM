Operation: finddefs Directory Report
File: finddefs.ndf


#
Finddefs looks for definition files (*.ndf) and documents the defined names
in each such file in a given directory. Only the top level definitions are found.
Local definitions within a block are not documented. The operation returns a list
of pairs: the first item of each pair is a definition file name, the second is the 
list of the defined names within that file.
