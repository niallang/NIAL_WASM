System operations for keyboard input in interactive mode:

The operation "readscreen" displays the string argument as a prompt
and stops, awaiting an entry. It accepts all text typed until the
<RETURN> as the input and assigns it to "Name" as a string.

.n Name gets readscreen 'Please type your name: ';

.n Name

The operation "read" displays the string argument as a prompt
and stops, awaiting an entry. The text entered is executed, which
causes a string representing numbers to be converted to numbers
or a string representing a Q'Nial expression to be evaluated.

.n X Y gets read 'X Y coordinates (Type 2 numbers): ' ;

.n X Y
.p
System operations to write to the screen in interactive mode:

The operation "writescreen" writes a string to the screen. 

.n writescreen 'Correct answer';

The operation "write" formats its argument as a character table and displays
the result on one or more lines.

.n write "Coordinates: X Y ;
.n write  "Coordinates: X Y (3 4 5)

The operation "writechars" writes a string to the screen without a newline:

.n writechars 'abc'; writescreen ' more text';


.p
The operation "edit" is used to edit a text file. It's argument is the name of
a file in the current directory as a phrase or string. For example:

    edit "test.ndf

would open the file test.ndf using the designated editor on the host 
operating system. If the file did not exist it is created as an empty 
file for the ditor.

Alternatively the argument can be a string that forms a path to file to be edited.
    edit "~/test1.ndf"
.p
