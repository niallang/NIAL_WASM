Getting Started with Q'Nial on a Fixed Disk IBM PC (DOS).


Q'Nial is provided in an archived format that compresses the files.
To use Q'Nial, the files must be removed from the archives and
placed on the fixed disk.

Step 1.  Extract the Q'Nial Files

The ADD90.bat file is used to extract and copy the files onto the fixed disk.

Batch File  Actions

ADD90.BAT   Extract files from Diskette 90.  Place Diskette 90 in the A Drive.
            With the default directory at the root for the fixed disk
            (eg. C:\), type:

            a:add90 <Return>


Step 2.  Run Q'Nial.

To run Q'Nial, change the default directory to v41root, run sample.bat,
and then run nial.  Type:

                  cd v41root <Enter>
                  sample     <Enter>
                  nial       <Enter>

After a few seconds, initial.nbs is loaded and the Q'Nial Version and Copyright
messages are displayed.  The messages clearws and profile loading appear and
then the Q'Nial Tutorial screen is displayed.

To change the background or text colors on the screen, change the values of
the following variables:

              __bgrd   which is initially equal to 1 representing Blue
                       on a color terminal and reverse video on a monochrome
                       one (used in: man "tally) ;

              __text   which is initially equal to 4 representing White on
                       a color terminal and "not underlined and not bold"
                       on a monochrome display (used in: man "tally).

              __cbck   initially equal to 10 representing Brightred on a
                       a color terminal and "not underlined and not bold"
                       on a monochrome display (used in: man "t).

              __ctxt   initially equal to 12 representing Brightwhite on
                       a color terminal and "not underlined and not bold"
                       on a monochrome display (used in: man "t).

If you would prefer a different colored background, type:

              __bgrd := 6 ; man "link <Enter>

and the background should become purple.  Each number from 0 to 15 has a color
associated with it as follows:

                Number  Color      Number  Color

                   0    Black         8    Grey
                   1    Blue          9    Bright Blue
                   2    Red          10    Bright Red
                   3    Yellow       11    Bright Yellow
                   4    White        12    Bright White
                   5    Light Blue   13    Sky Blue
                   6    Purple       14    Mauve
                   7    Green        15    Bright Green

The code may vary on non-IBM PC computers or with different graphics cards.

You give the color attribute to the variable by "assigning" a value.  This
is done either with ":=" or with the word "gets" as in:

         __text __bgrd gets 2 7 ; man "readscreen <Enter>

Experiment with these colors until you are satisfied with them.

On monochrome terminals, the three digits of the control tuple , which are
coded in this program as (__text __bgrd 0) represent:

       character type:
                              0  normal
                              1  underlined
                              2  bold
                              3  bold and underlined

        reverse video state:
                              0  not reverse video
                              1  reverse video

        blinking:
                              0  not blinking
                              1  blinking

Thus the initial values of (4 1 0) for (__text __bgrd 0) represent normal
display, reverse video, not blinking.

To get help on "tell" type:

                        man "tell <Enter>

A window of twelve lines and fifty columns is created in the upper right
corner of the screen.  An brief explanation of "tell" appears.  In the full
version of Q'Nial, if you typed

                         more <Return>

after reading the help message, you would receive a full screen message
providing more help on "tell".  The "more" option can be used again and
again to see more help.  However, it is not provided in this evaluation copy.

Type:

                         count <Enter>

the help message for "count" is displayed.

Now that "count" and "tell" are known, you can try using them.  For a starter,
display the addresses of an array having one axis and fifty items.  (That
would be a list of fifty items.)  The expression is:

                          tell 50 <Enter>

Now you can experiment with "count".  It returns numbers that are one greater
than the numbers produced by "tell".  Type:

                           count 50 <Enter>

Now see what the addresses are for a three dimensional table having 3 planes of
tables of 3 by 3 numbers.  Type:

                           tell 3 3 3 <Enter>

After reviewing this result, type:

                           tell 4 4 4 4 <Enter>

Type the following operation definition:

         mycalc is operation a b c x {a * x + b * x + c } <Enter>

or, if you are more at home writing business applications, type:
(the \ lets you continue the definition on the next line.)

         mycalc is operation Hours Rate Deductions { \  <Enter>
            Hours times Rate minus (sum Deductions) }   <Enter>

Now, you wish to use this operation.  If you entered the first operation, then
type:

           Result := mycalc 2. 3. 4. (count 10) <Enter>

If you entered the second one, type:

           Result := mycalc 40. 50. (100. 200. 300.) <Enter>

In either case, an interesting result should appear.  As with other Q'Nial
operations, the operation is applied to an array and returns an array result.
